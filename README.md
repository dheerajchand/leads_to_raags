# leads_to_raags

Analyze Western melodies and map them to Indian raags (Hindustani + Carnatic).
Given a lead sheet or melody, the tool suggests possible raags and gives hints on how to adapt the melody to sound more "raag-like."

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow
Prepare input
Start with MusicXML or MIDI of a melody (e.g., Stella by Starlight).
PDFs will need OCR ‚Üí MusicXML conversion (future step).
Melody extraction (core classes)
MelodyExtractor: load MusicXML/MIDI ‚Üí extract pitch sequence.
MelodyAnalyzer: normalize to scale degrees, build pitch sets.
Raag database
Structured JSON/YAML dataset of Hindustani + Carnatic raags:
Scale (aroha/avarohana).
Thaat/melakarta parent.
Vadi/samvadi (primary/secondary tones).
Pakad (signature phrases).
Matching engine
Compare melody pitch set vs. raag pitch sets.
Rank by overlap and phrase similarity.
Output candidate raags with match scores.
Adaptation suggestions
Suggest characteristic ornaments (gamakas, meends).
Suggest phrasing (pakad).
Optionally generate MIDI/MusicXML with adapted notes.
Web application (later)
Minimal FastAPI app: file upload ‚Üí JSON of candidate raags.
Frontend:
Staff rendering (VexFlow / ABC.js).
Audio playback of original vs. adapted melody.
Stretch goals
Support user libraries (store analyses).
Add AI/ML component: learn style of raag phrases beyond static pitch sets.
Interactive teaching mode (e.g. highlight "wrong" notes against chosen raag).üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow
